Repo of Deep Blue C Data Science Competition Team

#Goals
The goal of Deep Blue C is to develop and hone skillsets critical to successful applications of machine learning. Focus will be placed on data understanding and rapid analytics in order to simulate the ability to provide mission insights in a dynamic manner. 

The team will operate in a repeatable and programmatic manner such that the tradecraft trained in the completion process has immediate effect in operational settings. In order to codify this, the team follows a strict workflow and directory structure.

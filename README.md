# DeepBlueC
Repo of Deep Blue C Data Science Competition Team. The team competes in Data Science competition on a variety of platforms to include some live competitions. All data and code is licensed under the free-use MIT License unless otherwise specified. 

# Goals

## Applicability
The goal of DeepBlueC is to develop and hone skill-sets critical to successful applications of machine learning. Focus will be placed on data understanding and rapid analytics in order to simulate the ability to provide mission insights in a dynamic manner. With these goals, concepts pertaining to "small data science" have a central theme. Most datasets utilized in competitions, as well as in practice, have the ability to be stored in memory on a laptop. The team gives careful consideration to problems relating to outliers and overfitting in order to compensate for the relatively low size of data.

### Small-Data Science
This section will cover the lessons learned from working with small datasets.

### Data Understanding
This section will cover the lessons learned from placing an emphasis on teasing information out of the raw data.


## Repeatability
The team will operate in a repeatable and programmatic manner such that the trade-craft practiced in competition settings has immediate effect in operational settings. In order to codify this, the team follows a strict work-flow, and directory structure.  
### Directory
DeepBlueC utilizes the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) directory structure. This is done in order to allow for direct referencing to certain models and data across projects as well as very clean lanes of development.

### Work-flow
The first step of the work-flow is a write-up of the given problem set and and overview of the data fields given to work with. This is followed by some research into the domain the data reflects in order to inform future feature engineering and data manipulation. This is done in a Jupter notebook in order to allow for some data exploration along side subject matter research. It is stored in \[ProjectName\]/Notebooks/Maiden.ipynb.


## Critical Skill-sets Identification
There are many articles and opinions when it comes to the skill-sets and positions that make up a data science team. DeepBlueC offered a chance to better put into practice these theories through many iterations of competitive and time-sensitive objectives. These experiences have yielded the following results.

### Data Collection, Cleaning, Understanding

### Feature Engineering

### Model Crafting and Integration
